## Route Handlers

- We can also create custom request handlers for our routes using a feature called custom route handlers.
- Unlike page routes which will respond with HTML content, route handlers allow you to create Restful endpoints giving you full control over the response. we can perform CRUD operations with the database similar to node + express.js app.
- There is no overhead to create and configure a separate server. Nextjs provides everything you need out of the box.
- Route handlers are also great for making external API requests.
- Route handlers run server side ensuring that sensitive information like private keys remain secure and never gets shipped to the browser.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
